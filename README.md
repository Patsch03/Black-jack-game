## Approach taken
The way that I built this website was by doing all of the backend coding first, I made sure that everything functioned properly and then I implemented
HTML and CSS to make everything display on the webpage and look good.

## Project Structure 
The Structure is mainly javascript functions and game logic

## What went well
The part of this project that was the easiest and what I enjoyed the most was the logic design, I really enjoyed making the games backend.

## Hurdles 
The thing that I found the worst about this project was the frontend, I found it really difficult to make the webpage look good AND be functional at the
same time. I spent the majority of this project on the frontend making sure that everything was working and being displayed properly.
